As we coded the conference talks, we identified that almost all discussion surrounding technology fell into one of two categories: either (1) intentionally not using technology to avoid evil and distraction or (2) intentionally using technology for good.

# Guard Against Temptations and Distractions / Build Barriers to Avoid Bombardment (commandments - draw boundaries)

Many recommendations from the conference talks pertain to intentionally limiting technology use to guard against temptations and distractions. These recommendations include not letting technology interfere with important relationships with oneself, God, and others. They also involved guarding individuals and families from temptations that are facilitated by technology, like pornography. Other recommendations involved avoiding the toxicity on social media that often comes with idealized comparison with others as well as wisely moderating time spent on neutral activities with technology that would interfere with more important activities.

## Take time to be still (build barriers from distraction)

An often repeated warning was to not allow the incessant pull of modern technology to distract from more important aspects of life. One leader observed: “We live in a world of information overload, dominated by ever-increasing distractions that make it more and more difficult to sort through the commotion of this life and focus on things of eternal worth” (121). They warned that a focus on technology can cause people to get too caught up in their own lives: “... if we are not vigilant in how we use our personal devices, we… can begin to turn inward and forget that the essence of living the gospel is service” (119). They highlighted several things that technology can distract from: an individual’s relationship with God, one’s relationship with others, and from achieving one’s potential.

  

-   “Are you careful with your time—avoiding inappropriate technology and social media, including video games, which can dull your spiritual sensitivity?” (100)
    
-   “Do we set aside the phone, the never-ending to-do list, and the cares of worldliness?” (121)
    
-   “We live in a world of information overload, dominated by ever-increasing distractions that make it more and more difficult to sort through the commotion of this life and focus on things of eternal worth. Our daily lives are bombarded with attention-grabbing headlines, served up by rapidly changing technologies.” (047)
    
-   “. . .if we are not vigilant in how we use our personal devices, we too can begin to turn inward and forget that the essence of living the gospel is service.” (119)
    
-   “The poor use of time is a close cousin of idleness. As we follow the command to “cease to be idle” ([D&C 88:124](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/88.124?lang=eng#p124)), we must be sure that being busy also equates to being productive. For example, it is wonderful to have the means of instant communication quite literally at our fingertips, but let us be sure that we do not become compulsive fingertip communicators. I sense that some are trapped in a new time-consuming addiction—one that enslaves us to be constantly checking and sending social messages and thus giving the false impression of being busy and productive.” (001)
    
-   “In our day, there are many distractions, including Twitter, Facebook, virtual reality games, and much more.” (013)
    
-   “Elders and sisters, you simply cannot return from your mission, do a swan dive back into Babylon, and spend endless hours scoring meaningless points on pointless video games without falling into a deep spiritual sleep.” (106)
    
-   You “can get caught up in endless loops of triviality that waste your time and degrade your potential... There are countless ways technology can distract you from what is most important.” (017)
    
-   “The internet, our smartphones, our bloated boxes of entertainment all plead for our attention and thrust their influence upon us, hoping we will buy their products and adopt their standards.” (026)
    
-   “Those “seemingly insignificant” private decisions include how we use our time, what we view on television and the internet, what we read, the art and music with which we surround ourselves at work and at home, what we seek for entertainment, and how we apply our commitment to be honest and truthful.” (027)
    
-   “Suppose Church leaders reduce the time required by Church meetings and activities in order to increase the time available for families to be together. This will not achieve its intended purpose unless individual family members—especially parents—vigorously act to increase family togetherness and one-on-one time. Team sports and technology toys like video games and the Internet are already winning away the time of our children and youth. Surfing the Internet is not better than serving the Lord or strengthening the family. Some young men and women are skipping Church youth activities or cutting family time in order to participate in soccer leagues or to pursue various entertainments. Some young people are amusing themselves to death—spiritual death.” (061)
    
-   “Third, even as you try to cut out the extra commitments, sisters, find some time for yourself to cultivate your gifts and interests. Pick one or two things that you would like to learn or do that will enrich your life, and make time for them. Water cannot be drawn from an empty well, and if you are not setting aside a little time for what replenishes you, you will have less and less to give to others, even to your children. Avoid any kind of substance abuse, mistakenly thinking that it will help you accomplish more. And don’t allow yourself to be caught up in the time-wasting, mind-numbing things like television soap operas or surfing the Internet. Turn to the Lord in faith, and you will know what to do and how to do it.” (066)
    
-   “We live in a culture where more and more we are focused on the small, little screen in our hands than we are on the people around us.” (119)
    
-   “What could be more deceptive than to entice the youth of this noble generation to do nothing or to be busy ever-texting but never coming to a knowledge of the truths contained in a book that was written for you and your day by prophets of God—the Book of Mormon?” (124)
    
-   “Consider how we use our time in the choices we make in viewing television, playing video games, surfing the Internet… Of course it is good to view wholesome entertainment or to obtain interesting information. But not everything of that sort is worth the portion of our life we give to obtain it.” (061)
    
-   “Thus, video-gaming and texting on cell phones need to be added to the list. Some gamers claim to spend up to 18 hours a day going through level after level of video games, neglecting all other aspects of their lives. Texting on cell phones can become an addiction, causing the important interpersonal human communication to become lost. Not long ago a bishop told me two of his youth were standing side by side texting one another rather than talking to each other.” (103)
    
-   “Our parents’ basement, with unlimited video games, may be more appealing than college, marriage, or a career.” (104)
    
-   “It is refreshing to put aside our electronic devices for a while and instead turn the pages of the scriptures or take time to converse with family and friends. Especially on the Lord’s day, experience the peace of participating in a sacrament meeting without the constant urge to see if you have a new message or a new post.” (014)
    
-   “The habit of setting aside your mobile device for a time will enrich and broaden your view of life, for life is not confined to a four-inch (10-cm) screen.” (014)
    
-   “First, I invite you to participate in a 10-day fast from social media and from any other media that bring negative and impure thoughts to your mind. Pray to know which influences to remove during your fast. The effect of your 10-day fast may surprise you. What do you notice after taking a break from perspectives of the world that have been wounding your spirit? Is there a change in where you now want to spend your time and energy? Have any of your priorities shifted—even just a little? I urge you to record and follow through with each impression.” (015)
    
-   “President Russell M. Nelson invited the youth to step back from the world, disengaging from social media by holding a seven-day fast. And just last evening, he made a similar invitation to the sisters as part of the women’s session of conference. He then asked the youth to notice any differences in how they feel, what they think, or even how they think. He then invited them “to do a thorough life assessment with the Lord … to ensure that your feet are firmly planted on the covenant path.” He encouraged them that if there were things in their lives that needed changing, “today is the perfect time to change.” (047)
    
-   “We are surrounded by media influences and cultural deteriorations that will carry us downstream in our values if we are not continually resisting. To move upstream toward our eternal goal, we must constantly keep paddling. It helps if we are part of a team that is paddling together, like a rowing crew in action. To extend that example even further, the cultural currents are so strong that if we ever stop paddling, we will be carried downstream toward a destination we do not seek but which becomes inevitable if we do not constantly try to move forward.” (027)
    

### Don’t let it interfere with your relationship with God

The most persistent of these warnings pertained to not allowing technology to interfere with an individual’s relationship with God. Church leaders observed a number of ways that this interference can occur: by distracting individuals from praying to God, by preventing them from being still enough to hear God speaking to them, by encouraging them to rely more on the solutions of the world than answers from God, and by distracting them from honoring the Lord on the Sabbath day.

One leader commented: “How sad it would be if the phone and computer, with all their sophistication, drowned out the simplicity of sincere prayer to a loving Father in Heaven. Let us be as quick to kneel as we are to text” (001). And, to increase one’s ability to hear the resulting answers, another leader stated, “If we do not find time to unplug, we may miss opportunities to hear the voice of Him who said, ‘Be still, and know that I am God’” (034). Perhaps the tension between an individual’s relationship with God and the potential distraction of modern technology could be summarized with the following questions: What matters more, “[h]ow many ‘likes’ we get on our social media posts? Or how much we are loved and valued by our Heavenly Father?… Finding answers through an internet search? Or receiving answers from God through the Holy Ghost” (149)? The Church has consistently taught that members should demonstrate their respect for God by prioritizing their relationship with Him above all else, including stepping away at times from the distractions of technology.

  

-   “If we do not find time to unplug, we may miss opportunities to hear the voice of Him who said, “Be still, and know that I am God.” (034)
    
-   “Too many allow themselves to almost live online with their smart devices—screens illuminating their faces day and night and earbuds in their ears blocking out the still, small voice of the Spirit.“ (034)
    
-   “The Church has given you the Duty to God booklet as a resource to help you learn and fulfill your duties. Study it often. Get on your knees, away from technology, and seek the Lord’s guidance. And then arise and use the power of God. I promise that you will receive answers from Heavenly Father on how to conduct your own life and how to help others.” (073)
    
-   “As good as these things are, we cannot allow them to push to one side those things of greatest importance. How sad it would be if the phone and computer, with all their sophistication, drowned out the simplicity of sincere prayer to a loving Father in Heaven. Let us be as quick to kneel as we are to text.” (001)
    
-   “Many of the messages that bombard us in the information age are the spiritual equivalent of feeding hay to deer—we can eat it all day long, but it will not nourish us. Where do we find true spiritual nourishment? Most often, it is not trending on social media. We find it when we “press [our] way forward” on the covenant path, “continually holding fast to the rod of iron,” and partake of the fruit of the tree of life. This means that we must deliberately take time each day to disconnect from the world and connect with heaven.” (033)
    
-   “However, they can also distract us from the most important connection: our connection with heaven.” (114)
    
-   “The constant availability of social media and a 24-hour news cycle bombard us with relentless messages. If we are to have any hope of sifting through the myriad of voices and the philosophies of men that attack truth, we must learn to receive revelation.” (048)
    
-   “In order to help the Book of Mormon become the keystone of your testimony, I offer you a challenge. I recently learned that many young people spend an average of seven hours a day looking at TV, computer, and smartphone screens. With this in mind, would you make a small change? Will you replace some of that daily screen time—particularly that devoted to social media, the internet, gaming, or television—with reading the Book of Mormon? If the studies I referred to are accurate, you could easily find time for daily study of the Book of Mormon even if for only 10 minutes a day. And you can study in a way that allows you to enjoy it and understand it—either on your device or in book form. President Russell M. Nelson recently cautioned, “We should never make reading the Book of Mormon seem like an onerous duty, like the gulping of nasty medicine to be swallowed quickly and then checked off with finality.” (089)
    
-   “Here are some thoughts to consider. What mattereth most? How many “likes” we get on our social media posts? Or how much we are loved and valued by our Heavenly Father? …Finding answers through an internet search? Or receiving answers from God through the Holy Ghost?” (149)
    
-   “So what does the sum total of our thoughts, desires, words, and works say about our love for the Savior, His chosen servants, and His restored Church? Do our baptismal, priesthood, and temple covenants mean more to us than the praise of the world or the number of “likes” on social media? Is our love for the Lord and His commandments stronger than our love for anything or anyone else in this life?”(151)
    
-   “If we provide a still and quiet time each day when we are not bombarded by television, computer, video games, or personal electronic devices, we allow that still, small voice an opportunity to provide personal revelation and to whisper sweet guidance, reassurance, and comfort to us.” (105)
    
-   “You may need to reorganize your priorities to provide time for the study of the word of God. If so, do it!” (108)
    
-   “We live in unprecedented times long foretold by ancient prophets, a day when Satan rages “in the hearts of the children of men, and stir[s] them up to anger against that which is good.” Far too many of us live in a virtual world awash in entertainment and messaging hostile to divine identity and belief in Christ.” (158)
    

#### Don’t let technology get in the way of making the Sabbath Day holy

-   “Young people, if that teaching seems too general, here is a specific example. If the emblems of the sacrament are being passed and you are texting or whispering or playing video games or doing anything else to deny yourself essential spiritual food, you are severing your spiritual roots and moving yourself toward stony ground. You are making yourself vulnerable to withering away when you encounter tribulation like isolation, intimidation, or ridicule. And that applies to adults also.” (088)
    
-   “Texting or reading e-mails in a Church meeting is not only irreverent, it is distracting and signals a lack of respect for those around us.“ (120)
    
-   “Reverence includes turning off our cell phones and BlackBerry devices.” (120)
    
-   “Young people, it is not a time for whispered conversations on cell phones or for texting persons at other locations.” (122)
    

#### Don’t let it distract from receiving truth from God (discernment)

Not only can relationships and communication with God diminish as the distractions of technology abound, but turning to it as the source of truth instead of God can have devastating effects. Leaders have cautioned to be careful with information found online, because “not all of this information is true,” (028) and “we simply cannot rely upon information we bump into on social media.” (037) They recognize that all information online is not inherently bad -“we can find good and bad information on the web, but information alone is not enough” (138) and so they counsel to seek spiritual guidance when looking for truth. “If we are to have any hope of sifting through the myriad of voices and the philosophies of men that attack truth, we must learn to receive revelation.” (114) This process might be slower than a simple google for answers, but leaders promise blessings for turning to God. “Many in today’s world are looking for instant gratification and instant knowledge on the Internet. In contrast, we will be exceedingly blessed if we exercise faith and patience and go to our Heavenly Father, the source of all truth, with our concerns.” (064) As long as a search for answers involves God in the process and does not only rely on technology, truth will be found.

  
  
  

-   “We simply cannot rely upon information we bump into on social media.” (037)
    
-   “A Google search for “What is truth?” brings more than a million responses. We have more available information on our cell phones than in all the books of a brick and mortar library. We live with information and opinion overload. Enticing and alluring voices pursue us at every turn. ...our mortal quest is to strengthen our faith in the Lord Jesus Christ, to choose good over evil, and to keep His commandments. While we celebrate the innovations of science and medicine, the truths of God go far beyond these discoveries.” (042)
    
-   “But not all of this information [online] is true.” (028)
    
-   “We can find good and bad information on the web, but information alone is not enough.” (138)
    
-   “If we are to have any hope of sifting through the myriad of voices and the philosophies of men that attack truth, we must learn to receive revelation.” (114)
    
-   “Today, “living right” can be a pretty confusing concept, especially if you spend much time on social media, where any voice can declare real truths or false concepts about God and His plan for His children.” (050)
    
-   “Many in today’s world are looking for instant gratification and instant knowledge on the Internet. In contrast, we will be exceedingly blessed if we exercise faith and patience and go to our Heavenly Father, the source of all truth, with our concerns.  So many answers and assurances can come through daily searching and studying the scriptures and with sincere and pleading prayer, but there are no such promises on the Internet. The prophet Jacob testifies: “For the Spirit speaketh the truth and lieth not. Wherefore, it speaketh of things as they really are, and of things as they really will be.”” (064)
    
-   “The seemingly endless array of information and opinion remind us of the scriptural warnings of being “tossed to and fro,” “driven with the wind,” and overcome by the “cunning craftiness” of those who “lie in wait to deceive.” [new line] Anchoring our souls to the Lord Jesus Christ requires listening to those He sends. Following the prophet in a world of commotion is like being wrapped in a soothing, warm blanket on a freezing cold day.” (026)
    
-   “We should be cautious about relying on information or advice offered by entertainment stars, prominent athletes, or anonymous internet sources… Expertise in one field should not be taken as expertise on truth in other subjects.” (028)
    
-   “In a world of social media and information superhighways, one person’s voice can be multiplied exponentially. That voice, whether true or false, whether fair or prejudicial, whether kind or cruel, moves instantly across the world. Social media posts of thoughtfulness and goodness are often quietly under the radar, while words of contempt and anger are frequently thundering in our ears, whether with political philosophy, people in the news, or opinions on the pandemic. No one or no subject, including the Savior and His restored gospel, is immune from this social phenomenon of polarized voices… Because of social media platforms, one voice of disbelief can appear to be a multitude of negative voices, but even if it is a multitude of voices, we choose the path of peacemakers.”(147)
    
-   “If our spiritual foundation is shallow or superficial, we might be inclined to base our willingness on a social cost-benefit analysis or a personal inconvenience index. And if we embrace the narrative that the Church consists primarily of outdated or politically incorrect social policies, unrealistic personal restrictions, and time commitments, then our conclusions about willingness will be flawed. We should not expect the principle of willingness to trend positively with social media influencers or TikTok enthusiasts. The precepts of men rarely align with divine truth.” (158)
    

### Don’t let it distract you from relationships with family and others

Modern technology was also noted to be a major interference in keeping people from developing or maintaining meaningful relationships with others. While technology was observed to be very powerful in connecting people across distances, there are elements of modern technology that can make meaningful human interaction more challenging. It was observed that, in addition to “stifl[ing] the development of social skills” (016), technology addiction carries with it the danger of leading people to “give precedence to relationships with people [they]... have never met rather than [their]... own family” (014)! “Electronic games and cyber acquaintances are no lasting substitute for real friends who can give an encouraging hug, who can pray for us and seek after our best interest” (001).

Even when technology is used for communicating with loved ones, one leader warned, “I believe that we are not headed in the right direction… when we connect with family or friends mostly by reposting humorous pictures, forwarding trivial things, or linking our loved ones to sites on the Internet…. [H]ow much time are we willing to spend on it? If we fail to give our best personal self and undivided time to those who are truly important to us, one day we will regret it” (093).

To avoid these pitfalls, members were encouraged to be present and aware of those around them. “[W]hen you are with your friends, give them the gift of your attention” (017). “Instead of picking up your phone to see what your friends are doing, stop, look around, and ask yourself, ‘Who needs me today’” (119)?

-   “That typically means talking face to face with people and sometimes doing things together, not just perfecting your texting skills. Live your life so that as a man you will bring purity to your marriage and to your children.” (115)
    
-   “Young women and young men, next time you are at Mutual, instead of picking up your phone to see what your friends are doing, stop, look around, and ask yourself, “Who needs me today?” (119)
    
-   “However, I believe that we are not headed in the right direction, individually and as a society, when we connect with family or friends mostly by reposting humorous pictures, forwarding trivial things, or linking our loved ones to sites on the Internet.... how much time are we willing to spend on it? If we fail to give our best personal self and undivided time to those who are truly important to us, one day we will regret it.” (093)
    
-   “More and more, young people are isolating themselves from others by playing video games; wearing headphones; and interacting through cell phones, e-mail, text messaging, and so on instead of in person.” (102)
    
-   “We are often more concerned with how many followers and likes we have than with putting an arm around a friend and showing love, concern, and tangible interest.” (119)
    
-   “We have substituted texting and tweeting for actually looking someone in the eye and smiling or, even rarer, having a face-to-face conversation.” (119)
    
-   “Distractions can sometimes prevent us from experiencing God’s love in our family relationships and activities. A mother, feeling that gadgets were taking over her family relationships, came up with a solution. At the dinner table and at other family times, she just calls out, “Phones on the deck; let us have face time.” She says that this is the new norm for their family and that it strengthens their relationship as a family when they have real face time. They now enjoy quality Come, Follow Me discussions together as a family.” (058)
    
-   “The use of social media, mobile apps, and games can be inordinately time-consuming and can reduce face-to-face interaction. This loss of personal conversation can affect marriages, take the place of valuable spiritual practices, and stifle the development of social skills, especially among youth.” (016)
    
-   “Why not choose a time each day to disconnect from technology and reconnect with each other? Simply turn everything off. When you do this, your home may seem quiet at first; you may even feel at a loss as to what to do or say. Then, as you give full attention to your children, a conversation will begin, and you can enjoy listening to each other.” (110)
    
-   “In this age of “I choose me,” societies benefit when generations connect in meaningful ways. We need roots to have wings—real relationships, meaningful service, life beyond fleeting social media veneers.”(148)
    
-   “Electronic games and cyber acquaintances are no lasting substitute for real friends who can give an encouraging hug, who can pray for us and seek after our best interest” (001)
    
-   “This networked life can, if left unchecked, give precedence to relationships with people whom we don’t know or have never met rather than with the people we live with—our own family!” (014)
    
-   “There are countless ways technology can distract you from what is most important. Follow the adage ‘Be where you are when you are there’ When you are driving, drive. When you are in class, focus on the lesson. When you are with your friends, give them the gift of your attention” (017).
    
-   “Months ago, during the sacrament, I asked myself these questions and was surprised by the impression that came. “Stop looking at your phone when you are waiting in lines.” Looking at my phone in lines had become almost automatic; I found it a good time to multitask, catch up on email, look at headlines, or scroll through a social media feed. The next morning, I found myself waiting in a long line at the store. I pulled out my phone and then remembered the impression I had received. I put my phone away and looked around. I saw an elderly gentleman in line ahead of me. His cart was empty except for a few cans of cat food. I felt a little awkward but said something really clever like, “I can see you have a cat.” He said that a storm was coming, and he did not want to be caught without cat food. We visited briefly, and then he turned to me and said, “You know, I haven’t told anyone this, but today is my birthday.” My heart melted. I wished him a happy birthday and offered a silent prayer of thanks that I had not been on my phone and missed an opportunity to truly see and connect with another person who needed it. With all of my heart I do not want to be like the priest or the Levite on the road to Jericho—one who looks and passes by.[7](https://abn.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2020/10/14craig?lang=eng&adobe_mc_ref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.churchofjesuschrist.org%2Fstudy%2Fgeneral-conference%2F2020%2F10%2F14craig%3Flang%3Deng&adobe_mc_sdid=SDID%3D5649710DEF7601CA-03B2D16D200C5ED1%7CMCORGID%3D66C5485451E56AAE0A490D45%2540AdobeOrg%7CTS%3D1643218970#note7) But too often I think I am.” (051)
    
-   “In all of these family council settings, electronic devices need to be turned off so everyone can look at and listen to each other. During family councils and at other appropriate times, you may want to have a basket for the electronic devices so when the family gathers, everyone—including Mom and Dad—can deposit his or her phones, tablets, and MP3 players in the basket. Thereafter, they can counsel together without being tempted to respond to a poke on Facebook, to a text, to Instagram, to Snapchat, or to email alerts.” (004)
    
-   “Brethren, if you will set aside your cell phone and actually look around a little, you may even find your future companion at the institute.” (100)
    

### Don’t let it distract from letting you achieve your personal divine potential

Not only can technology distract from fostering meaningful relationships with others, it can also “distract… from fulfilling [their] divine potential.” (013) One leader observed that the same technology that can be used for so much good can also be used by Satan “to tempt you and to ensnare you in his web of deceit, thereby hoping to take possession of your destiny.” (098)

-   “Satan can keep us busy, distracted, and infected by sifting through information, much of which can be pure garbage.” (009)
    
-   “For instance, the very technological tools I have mentioned provide opportunities for the adversary to tempt you and to ensnare you in his web of deceit, thereby hoping to take possession of your destiny.” (098)
    
-   “...but if we are not careful, they can distract us from fulfilling our divine potential.” (013)
    
-   “Could it be that we have been deceived by false role models and persuasive media messages that cause us to forget our divine identity?” (124)
    
-   “In a recent sacrament meeting I attended, a returned missionary quoted a father who summed up this idea perfectly when he said to his children, “What we need here is less Wi-Fi and more Nephi! …There is no treasure, nor any hobby, nor any status, nor any social media, nor any video games, nor any sport, nor any association with a celebrity, nor anything on earth that is more precious than eternal life. So the Lord’s counsel to every person is “consider your ways.” (030)
    
-   “Be selective and don’t allow this surge of information to distract you or slow your progress.“ (107)
    

## Resist natural temptations

An oft repeated phrase found in the teachings of the Church is to “put off the natural man.” This phrase comes from the Book of Mormon (Mosiah 3:19) and refers to the process of overcoming temptations common to all humans. These temptations include the human tendencies to “be lazy, complacent, discouraged, indifferent,… doubting… [or to give] in to appetites of the flesh, such as pornography…” ([Putting Off the Natural Man and Becoming Saints](https://speeches.byu.edu/talks/carl-b-cook/putting-natural-man-becoming-saints/)). Many conference talks demonstrated how modern technology often facilitates natural temptations. Modern technology has made it such that the choice to give into temptation or not “will often be as subtle as to click or not to click” (087).

Church leaders warned against a variety of “natural man” temptations that are facilitated by modern technology. They taught that “the modern internet creates challenges to avoiding pride” (096) because the vast amount of secular knowledge makes it easy “[look] to the ‘arm of flesh’” (136), (i.e., trust in the wisdom of man instead of God’s power). They also warned that Satan “uses this [the internet] to promote doubt” (009) and “[sow] misinformation” in order “to cause… fear in our hearts and minds” (035). They also warned of technology addiction, such as the “time-consuming addiction... that enslaves us to be constantly checking and sending social messages [and gives]... the false impression of being busy and productive” (001). However, by far the most frequent warnings regarding resisting these temptations pertained to avoiding pornography.

### In General

-   “It follows that such cutting off refers not only to friends but to every bad influence, such as inappropriate television shows, Internet sites, movies, literature, games, or music. Engraving in our souls this principle will help us to resist the temptation to yield to any bad influence.” (069)
    
-   “The demonstration of righteous courage will often be as subtle as to click or not to click. Missionaries are taught from Preach My Gospel, “What you choose to think and do when you are alone and you believe no one is watching is a strong measure of your virtue.”[5](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2012/10/be-valiant-in-courage-strength-and-activity.html?lang=eng#note5) Be courageous! Be strong! “Stand ye in holy places, and be not moved.” (087)
    
-   “Ethan, a young friend of mine, approached his mother with a weighty question. Like most teenagers, Ethan wants to be independent, self-sufficient, and surrounded by good friends. He is trying to make good choices on his own. He is exceedingly valiant, works hard on his grades, and studies the scriptures daily. Like all young people, Ethan faces tremendous temptations. It comes in the halls of his school, on the Internet, in the movies and music. It can be heard in bad language and seen in provocative clothing. That which is wrong is often made to look right. Anxiety and fear of rejection are common among teenagers. Peer pressure is often overpowering. Ethan was feeling bombarded with opposing values.” (070)
    
-   “As popular culture across the world degenerates, sleaze increasingly saturates the media, entertainment, advertising, and the Internet. But popularity according to the world’s prevailing norms is a very perilous scale to use to measure what’s right or even what’s not dangerous. A movie or television show may be well known and well liked by millions of viewers and nevertheless portray images and conduct that are pornographic. If something in a movie “isn’t too bad,” that automatically means that it isn’t too good either. Thus, the fact that others watch movies or open Web sites that aren’t appropriate is no excuse for us. Priesthood holders’ lives should emulate the standards of the Savior and His Church, not the standards of the world.” (072)
    
-   “We should avoid inappropriate material on the Internet and on cell phones, as well as offensive music and suggestive dancing. You may be mocked, you may have fingers pointed at you, you may have to stand alone, but please have the courage to withstand these temptations.” (081)
    
-   “This is a day of sometimes merciless attacks in social media and in person against those who seek to uphold the Lord’s standard in dress, entertainment, and sexual purity.” (049)
    

  

### Resist temptation to give into doubt and fear

Several talks discussed the principle that modern technology can facilitate Satan’s efforts to spread doubt and fear. Speaking of the internet, one leader said, “Satan wants us to be miserable, and he distorts the real purpose of things. He uses this great tool to promote doubt and fear and to destroy faith and hope” (009). In addition to blatant evils such as pornography and cyberbullying, another leader observed that Satan uses the internet to “[sow] misinformation to cause doubt and fear in our hearts and minds” (035).

-   “Satan wants us to be miserable, and he distorts the real purpose of things. He uses this great tool to promote doubt and fear and to destroy faith and hope” (009)
    
-   “He immerses us in the various negative elements that can exist in social media, including debilitating comparisons and idealized reality. In addition, he camouflages other dark, harmful content found online, such as pornography, blatant attacks on others through cyberbullying, and sowing misinformation to cause doubt and fear in our hearts and minds. Cunningly he whispers, “Just follow me, and you will surely be happy.”” (035)
    
-   “Another potential destroyer of spiritual roots—accelerated by current technology but not unique to it—is the keyhole view of the gospel or the Church. This limited view focuses on a particular doctrine or practice or perceived deficiency in a leader and ignores the grand panorama of the gospel plan and the personal and communal fruits of its harvest. President Gordon B. Hinckley gave a vivid description of one aspect of this keyhole view. He told a BYU audience about political commentators “aflame with indignation” at a then-recent news event. “With studied art they poured out the sour vinegar of invective and anger. … Surely,” he concluded, “this is the age and place of the gifted pickle sucker.”[1](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2015/04/the-parable-of-the-sower.p13?lang=eng#note1) In contrast, to be securely rooted in the gospel, we must be moderate and measured in criticism and seek always for the broader view of the majestic work of God.”” (088)
    

### Resist temptation to rely on things of man instead of God

  

-   “With technology today, information on a myriad of subjects is available with the click of a keystroke. It is easy to get caught in the trap of looking to the “arm of flesh”[5](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2010/10/our-very-survival?lang=eng#note5)” (136)
    
-   “In our quest for humility, the modern internet creates challenges to avoiding pride.” (096)
    

### Avoid Addictions

-   “These addictions that control us come in many forms, such as pornography, alcohol, sex, drugs, tobacco or cigarettes, gambling, food, work, the Internet, or virtual reality. Satan, the enemy of us all, uses many methods to lose our divine potential to carry out our mission in the Lord's kingdom.” (002)
    
-   “I sense that some are trapped in a new time-consuming addiction—one that enslaves us to be constantly checking and sending social messages and thus giving the false impression of being busy and productive.” (001)
    
-   “My young sisters—and adult women too—it will bless your lives if you limit your use of and dependence on cell phones.” (012)
    

#### Avoid Pornography

The most repeated warning surrounding modern technology had to do with pornography use. Church leaders have always warned strongly against pornography (online or not) because of its “overpoweringly addictive” (142) and “destructive” (111) nature.

The Church has described pornography as destructive for many reason. The official Church handbook states that: “Pornography use of any kind damages individual lives, families, and society” (P5).

Porngraphy use has been shown to decrease an individual’s self-confidence and lead to a loss of self-control, as well as deep feelings of guilt and shame (P1, P4, P6). It has the physiological effects of increasing obsessive-compulsive thoughts and behaviors, anxiety, and depression (P1, P3). Interestingly, it has even been shown to contribute to a smaller, less active brain (P1). Pornography use often becomes an “overwhelming addiction” that can lead to a “total consumption of time, thought, and energy” (P1, see also P7). It also inhibits an individual's ability to “enjoy a normal emotional, romantic, and spiritual relationship with a person of the opposite sex” (P2) and leads to “relationship difficulties”(P4) in general due to an increased propensity towards isolation (P3) and dishonesty (P1) among other things. Specifically of importance to Church members is the oft repeated teaching that pornography “drives away the Spirit of the Lord” (P5). As one leader put it: “you [cannot] indulge in online pornography… without dire spiritual consequences. If you lose the Spirit, you are lost” (106).

Pornography use not only harms individuals but also has a devastating effect on families, much like the effects of second-hand smoke. Previous Church president, Gordon Hinkcley, described the plague of pornography in 2004: “It is like a raging storm, destroying… families, utterly ruining what was once wholesome and beautiful” (P7). Pornography can leave users with “unrealistic expectations and misinformation about sexual intimacy; conditioning us to see people as objects to be used and abused” (P3). Users are also more likely “to act out what they have witnessed, regardless of its effects on their life and the lives of others” (P2). For these reasons, “it has the effect of damaging hearts and souls to their very depths, strangling the life out of relationships that should be sacred, hurting to the very core those you should love the most” (P7).

And, besides the fact that society is made up of individuals and families, pornography use is of concern to society in general because it has been shown to be correlated with violence and criminal activity (P1, P2, P7).

One leader observed that the Savior condemned 19th century Church members “for their ‘lustful… desires’ [D&C 101:6]” even “in a non-television, non-film, non-Internet, non-iPod world” (080). As the internet has made pornography even more accessible, Church leaders have continued to echo the plea of avoidance, because “[Satan] is busy extending his coverage… to cell phones, video games, and MP3 players,” “to make sure [pornography] is ever more accessible” (083).

While many choices in life are trivial, Church members are warned that, “whether you decide to push a key on your computer which will take you to pornography can make all the difference in your life” (143, emphasis added). By far, the most stern and intense warnings surrounding technology use pertained to pornography.

  

-   “Seductive romance novels, TV soap operas, married women and old boyfriends connecting on social media, and pornography. We must be so careful, dear sisters! We cannot play with Satan’s fiery darts and not get burned. I know of nothing that will qualify us for the constant companionship of the Holy Ghost as much as virtue.” (064)
    
-   “My young brethren and sisters, wherever I travel, I meet noble youth just like you who are faced constantly with modern-day Goliaths in the form of temptations that would cause us to violate our covenants and the standards the Lord has given us. This becomes even more important when you are surrounded daily with profanity, socially accepted immorality, immodesty, pornography, and other inappropriate material in the media, including television and the Internet, and widespread availability of drugs and alcohol. In a word, not a day goes by that we are not asked, in one form or another, “Who’s on the Lord’s side? Who?” I have two simple suggestions to help you prepare your answer to that question.” (071)
    
-   “Advances in many areas that can be used for good can also be used to speed us along those heinous pathways.I feel to mention one in particular, and that is the Internet. On one hand, it provides nearly limitless opportunities for acquiring useful and important information. Through it we can communicate with others around the world. The Church itself has a wonderful Web site, filled with valuable and uplifting information and priceless resources. On the other hand, however—and extremely alarming—are the reports of the number of individuals who are utilizing the Internet for evil and degrading purposes, the viewing of pornography being the most prevalent of these purposes. My brothers and sisters, involvement in such will literally destroy the spirit. Be strong. Be clean. Avoid such degrading and destructive types of content at all costs—wherever they may be! I sound this warning to everyone, everywhere. I add—particularly to the young people—that this includes pornographic images transmitted via cell phones.” (157)
    
-   “I might discuss with you what is happening on the Internet and with the use of the computer that leads to degrading thoughts and actions. Suffice it to say it is totally unbecoming you as one who holds the priesthood of God. You are His chosen servant; you have been ordained to something holy and wonderful. You cannot live in the world and partake of the ways of the world. You must be above all of that.” (078)
    
-   “Nor can you indulge in online pornography and ignore virtue and chastity without dire spiritual consequences. If you lose the Spirit, you are lost. Don’t be distracted and deceived.” (106)
    
-   “But their inappropriate use—such as involvement in time-wasting games, programs that would drive you to carnal pleasure, or much worse things such as pornography—is destructive.” (111)
    
-   “What could be more deceptive than to entice men—young and old, holding the holy priesthood of God—to view seductive pornography and thus focus on flesh instead of faith, to be consumers of vice rather than guardians of virtue?” (124)
    
-   “Whether it be through the printed page, movies, television, obscene lyrics, vulgarities on the telephone, or flickering personal computer screen, pornography is overpoweringly addictive and severely damaging.” (142)
    
-   “However, whether you decide to push a key on your computer which will take you to pornography can make all the difference in your life.” (143)
    
-   “No priesthood holder who wants to succeed will be careless about where his eyes may go. Choosing to look at images which incite lust will cause the Spirit to withdraw. You have been warned by Elder Clayton as well as you may ever be warned about the dangers of the Internet and the media in putting pornographic images before us. But immodesty is now so common that everyday life requires discipline—a conscious choice not to linger watching whatever might create in us feelings which would repel the Spirit.” (079)
    
-   “The Savior was critical of some of the early Saints for their “lustful … desires” ([D&C 101:6](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/101.6?lang=eng#p6); see also [D&C 88:121](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/88.121?lang=eng#p121)). These were people who lived in a non-television, non-film, non-Internet, non-iPod world. In a world now awash in sexualized images and music, are we free from lustful desires and their attendant evils? Far from pushing the limits of modest dress or indulging in the vicarious immorality of pornography, we are to hunger and thirst after righteousness. To come to Zion, it is not enough for you or me to be somewhat less wicked than others. We are to become not only good but holy men and women. Recalling Elder Neal A. Maxwell’s phrase, let us once and for all establish our residence in Zion and give up the summer cottage in Babylon” (080)
    
-   “The darker sides of the movie, television, and music industry step further and further into offensive language and sexual misconduct. Tragically, the same computer and Internet service that allows me to do my family history and prepare those names for temple work could, without filters and controls, allow my children or grandchildren access to a global cesspool of perceptions that could blast a crater in their brains forever.” (083)
    
-   “The computer is a wonderful instrument when it is properly used. But when it is used to deal with pornography or so-called chat rooms or for any other purpose that leads to evil practices or evil thoughts, then there must be self-discipline enough to turn it off.” (022)
    
-   “One of the most accessible sources of pornography today is the Internet, where one can turn on a computer and instantly have at his fingertips countless sites featuring pornography. President Gordon B. Hinckley has said: “I fear this may be going on in some of your homes. It is vicious. It is lewd and filthy. It is enticing and habit-forming. It will take [you] down to destruction as surely as anything in this world. It is foul sleaze that makes its exploiters wealthy, its victims impoverished.”[4](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2006/04/true-to-the-faith?lang=eng#note4) [new line] Tainted as well is the movie producer, the television programmer, or the entertainer who promotes pornography. Long gone are the restraints of yesteryear. So-called realism is the quest, with the result that today we are surrounded by this filth. [new line] Avoid any semblance of pornography. It will desensitize the spirit and erode the conscience. We are told in the Doctrine and Covenants, “That which doth not edify is not of God, and is darkness.”[5](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2006/04/true-to-the-faith?lang=eng#note5) Such is pornography.” (024)
    
-   “Do you avoid viewing pornography or looking at websites, magazines, movies, or apps, including Tinder and Snapchat photos, that would embarrass you if your parents, Church leaders, or the Savior Himself saw you?” (100)
    
-   “Figuratively, all of us need to transform ourselves into modern Captain Moronis in order to win the wars against evil. I know a very faithful young deacon who transformed himself into a modern Captain Moroni. Inasmuch as he has sought to follow the counsel of his parents and Church leaders, his faith and determination have been tested every day, even at his young age. He told me one day he was surprised by a very difficult and uncomfortable situation—his friends were accessing pornographic images on their cell phones. In that exact moment, this young man had to decide what was most important—his popularity or his righteousness. In the few seconds that followed, he was filled with courage and told his friends that what they were doing was not right. Moreover, he told them that they should stop what they were doing or they would become slaves to it. Most of his classmates ridiculed his counsel, saying that it was a part of life and that there was nothing wrong with it. However, there was one among them who listened to the counsel of that young man and decided to stop what he was doing.” (155)
    
-   “Sexual immorality and impure thoughts violate the standard established by the Savior. We were warned at the beginning of this dispensation that sexual immorality would be perhaps the greatest challenge. Such conduct will, without repentance, cause a spiritual drought and loss of commitment. Movies, TV, and the Internet often convey degrading messages and images. President Dieter F. Uchtdorf and I were recently in an Amazon jungle village and observed satellite dishes even on some of the small, simply built huts. We rejoiced at the wonderful information available in this remote area. We also recognized there is virtually no place on earth that cannot be impacted by salacious, immoral, and titillating images. This is one reason why pornography has become such a plague in our day.” (156)
    
-   “I recently had an insightful conversation with a 15-year-old Aaronic Priesthood holder. He helped me understand how easy it is in this Internet age for young people to almost inadvertently be exposed to impure and even pornographic images. He pointed out that for most principles the Church teaches, there is at least some recognition in society at large that violating these principles can have devastating effects on health and well-being. He mentioned cigarette smoking, drug use, and alcohol consumption by young people. But he noted that there is no corresponding outcry or even a significant warning from society at large about pornography or immorality.” (156)
    

## Protect families and others from evil

The Church has officially declared that “‘the family is ordained of God.’”(028) One leader said, “[We are] properly known as a family-centered Church. But what is not well understood is that our family-centeredness is focused on more than mortal relationships. Eternal relationships are also fundamental to our theology.” (028) Because family relationships are so important, parents are responsible for the raising of and the education of their children. “In our view, the ultimate treasures on earth and in heaven are our children and our posterity. Therefore, we must teach and contend for principles and practices that provide the best conditions for the development and happiness of children—all children.” (028) Because parents have an eternal obligation to care for and teach their children, it is no surprise that leaders counsel parents to keep their families physically and virtually safe. “By example we can help our children understand that spending long periods of time using the Internet, social media, and cell phones; playing video games; or watching television keeps us from productive activities and valuable interactions with others.” (085)

Leaders also recommend holding family councils to “counter the impact of modern technology that often distracts us from spending quality time with each other and also tends to bring evil right into our homes.” (004) “As we counsel with our children, together we can create a family plan with standards and boundaries, being proactive to protect our homes with filters on electronic devices.” (075) The leaders of the Church understand the value of guarding against evils of the world as a family, which protects individuals and strengthens family bonds. This process helps to guard against pornography, cyberbullying, and addictions. (041)

Not only are families encouraged to guard against technology, leaders have stipulated that parents must “vigorously act to increase family togetherness and one-on-one time.”(061) “Families need unstructured time when relationships can deepen and real parenting can take place. Take time to listen, to laugh, and to play together.” (066) Parents are also encouraged to use technology wisely to set a good example for their families, not just prohibit its use. “Let us also teach and demonstrate the righteous use of technology to the rising generation and warn against the associated hazards and destructive use of it.“ (016)

  

  
  

-   Holding a “family council...will counter the impact of modern technology that often distracts us from spending quality time with each other and also tends to bring evil right into our homes.” (004)
    
-   “[D]on’t overschedule yourselves or your children. We live in a world that is filled with options. If we are not careful, we will find every minute jammed with social events, classes, exercise time, book clubs, scrapbooking, Church callings, music, sports, the use this Internet, and our favorite TV shows. ... Families need unstructured time when relationships can deepen and real parenting can take place. Take time to listen, to laugh, and to play together.” (066)
    
-   “Parents, the days are long past when regular, active participation in Church meetings and programs, though essential, can fulfill your sacred responsibility to teach your children to live moral, righteous lives and walk uprightly before the Lord. With President Monson’s announcement this morning, it is essential that this be faithfully accomplished in homes which are places of refuge where kindness, forgiveness, truth, and righteousness prevail. Parents must have the courage to filter or monitor Internet access, television, movies, and music. Parents must have the courage to say no, defend truth, and bear powerful testimony. Your children need to know that you have faith in the Savior, love your Heavenly Father, and sustain the leaders of the Church. Spiritual maturity must flourish in our homes. My hope is that no one will leave this conference without understanding that the moral issues of our day must be addressed in the family. Bishops and priesthood and auxiliary leaders need to support families and make sure that spiritual principles are taught. Home and visiting teachers can assist, especially with children of single parents.” (156)
    
-   “Suppose Church leaders reduce the time required by Church meetings and activities in order to increase the time available for families to be together. This will not achieve its intended purpose unless individual family members—especially parents—vigorously act to increase family togetherness and one-on-one time. Team sports and technology toys like video games and the Internet are already winning away the time of our children and youth. Surfing the Internet is not better than serving the Lord or strengthening the family. Some young men and women are skipping Church youth activities or cutting family time in order to participate in soccer leagues or to pursue various entertainments. Some young people are amusing themselves to death—spiritual death.” (061)
    
-   “All of the virtues and appropriate use of these technologies notwithstanding, there are risks associated with them that, when drawn too close, can put us in a spiritual eclipse and potentially block the brightness and warmth of the gospel.” (016)
    
-   “Let us also teach and demonstrate the righteous use of technology to the rising generation and warn against the associated hazards and destructive use of it.“ (016)
    
-   “The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is properly known as a family-centered Church. But what is not well understood is that our family-centeredness is focused on more than mortal relationships. Eternal relationships are also fundamental to our theology. “The family is ordained of God.”(028)
    
-   “Fifth, we also have a distinctive perspective on children. We look on the bearing and nurturing of children as part of God’s plan and a joyful and sacred duty of those given the power to participate in it. In our view, the ultimate treasures on earth and in heaven are our children and our posterity. Therefore, we must teach and contend for principles and practices that provide the best conditions for the development and happiness of children—all children.”(028)
    
-   “One problem is that much of the media and entertainment that the world shares does not reflect the priorities and values of the majority. For whatever reasons, too much of our television, movies, music, and Internet present a classic case of a minority masquerading as a majority. Immorality and amorality, ranging from graphic violence to recreational sex, is portrayed as the norm and can cause those who have mainstream values to feel like we are out of date or from a bygone era. In such a media and Internet-dominated world, it has never been harder to raise responsible children and to keep marriages and families together.” (068)
    
-   “All throughout my son’s teenage years, I worried and tried to stop him from playing violent video games. I talked to my husband and showed him articles in the Ensign and in the newspaper that cautioned about these games. But my husband felt it was OK. He said that our son wasn’t out using drugs and that I should stop worrying. There were times that I would hide the controllers, and my husband would give them back. It began to be easier for me to give in … than to fight it. I really feel that gaming is just as addictive as drugs. I would do anything to prevent other parents from going through this experience.” (101)
    
-   “Organize your personal lives to provide time for prayer and scriptures and family activity. Give your children responsibilities in the home that will teach them how to work. Teach them that living the gospel will lead them away from the filth, promiscuity, and violence of the Internet, media, and video games. They will not be lost, and they will be prepared to handle responsibility when it is thrust upon them.” (086)
    
-   “By example we can help our children understand that spending long periods of time using the Internet, social media, and cell phones; playing video games; or watching television keeps us from productive activities and valuable interactions with others.” (085)
    
-   “To an alarming extent, our children today are being educated by the media, including the Internet. In the United States, it is reported that the average child watches approximately four hours of television daily, much of the programming being filled with violence, alcohol and drug use, and sexual content. Watching movies and playing video games is in addition to the four hours.[6](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2007/10/three-goals-to-guide-you?lang=eng#note6) And the statistics are much the same for other developed countries. The messages portrayed on television, in movies, and in other media are very often in direct opposition to that which we want our children to embrace and hold dear. It is our responsibility not only to teach them to be sound in spirit and doctrine but also to help them stay that way, regardless of the outside forces they may encounter. This will require much time and effort on our part—and in order to help others, we ourselves need the spiritual and moral courage to withstand the evil we see on every side.” (091)
    
-   “Soon, though, he substituted watching a video on his phone with the toddler until his wife returned.” (110)
    
-   “An ever-present danger to the family is the onslaught of evil forces that seem to come from every direction. While our primary effort must be to seek light and truth, we would be wise to black out from our homes the lethal bombs that destroy spiritual development and growth. Pornography, in particular, is a weapon of mass moral destruction. Its impact is at the forefront in eroding moral values. Some TV programs and Internet sites are equally lethal. These evil forces remove light and hope from the world. The level of decadence is accelerating. If we do not black out evil from our homes and lives, do not be surprised if devastating moral explosions shatter the peace which is the reward for righteous living. Our responsibility is to be in the world but not of the world.” (092)
    
-   “We must model that which is virtuous and lovely by our personal media choices. We must take care that the media we invite into our homes does not dull the sensitivity to the Spirit, harm relationships with our family and friends, or reveal personal priorities that are inconsistent with gospel principles.” (085)
    
-   “This year’s survey reveals a new kind of potent peer pressure—digital peer pressure. Digital peer pressure moves beyond a child’s friends and the kids they hang out with. It invades the home and a child’s bedroom via the Internet.” (087)
    
-   “One father wisely responds to his children with their numerous requests to participate in these distractions. He simply asks them, “Will this make you a better person?”” (065)
    
-   “Third, dare to have the “big talks” with your sons. You know what I mean: talks about drugs and drinking, about the dangers of today’s media—the Internet, cyber technologies, and pornography—and about priesthood worthiness, respect for girls, and moral cleanliness. While these should not be the only subjects you talk about with your sons, please don’t shy away from them. Your boys need your counsel, guidance, and input on these subjects. As you talk about these very important matters, you will find that the trust between you will flourish.” (082)
    

### Protect from pornography

-   “Pornography is more vile, evil, and graphic than ever before. As we counsel with our children, together we can create a family plan with standards and boundaries, being proactive to protect our homes with filters on electronic devices. Parents, are we aware that mobile devices with Internet capacity, not computers, are the biggest culprit? ... [new line] Youth, take responsibility for your own spiritual well-being. Turn off your phone if necessary, sing a Primary song, pray for help, think of a scripture, walk out of a movie, picture the Savior, take the sacrament worthily, study For the Strength of Youth, be an example to your friends, confide in a parent, go see your bishop, ask for help, and seek professional counseling, if needed.” (075)
    
-   “Remember that those young wives said their husbands’ infidelity began with an attraction to pornography, but immoral activity is not just a man’s problem, and husbands aren’t the only ones offending. The compromise available at the click of a mouse—including what can happen in a chat room’s virtual encounter—is no respecter of persons, male or female, young or old, married or single. And just to make sure that temptation is ever more accessible, the adversary is busy extending his coverage, as they say in the industry, to cell phones, video games, and MP3 players.” (083)
    
-   “These same technologies can allow evil influences to cross the threshold of your homes. These dangerous traps are only a mouse click away. Pornography, violence, intolerance, and ungodliness destroy families, marriages, and individual lives. These dangers are distributed through many media, including magazines, books, television, movies, and music, as well as the Internet. The Lord will help you to recognize and avoid those evils. It is the early recognition of danger and a clear course correction that will keep you in the light of the gospel. Minor decisions can lead to major consequences [new line] Entering a strange and risky chat room on the Internet could lead you into the center of a raging storm. Putting a computer in a private room that the rest of the family cannot access could be the starting point for a deceitful and dangerous journey.” (063)
    
-   “The darker sides of the movie, television, and music industry step further and further into offensive language and sexual misconduct. Tragically, the same computer and Internet service that allows me to do my family history and prepare those names for temple work could, without filters and controls, allow my children or grandchildren access to a global cesspool of perceptions that could blast a crater in their brains forever.” (083)
    

### Protect marriages through digital trust

-   “Loyalty is a form of respect. Prophets teach that successful marriage partners are “fiercely loyal” to each other. They keep their social media use fully worthy in every way. They permit themselves no secret Internet experiences. They freely share with each other their social network passwords. They do not look at the virtual profiles of anyone in any way that might betray the sacred trust of their spouse. They never do or say anything that approaches the appearance of impropriety, either virtually or physically. Watch and learn: terrific marriages are completely respectful, transparent, and loyal.” (074)
    

### Protect others from cyberbullying

-   “There is no place for [bullying] in your cyberspace, neighborhoods, schools, quorums, or classes. Please do all you can to make these places kinder and safer...” (041)
    
-   “While bullying is not a new concept, social media and technology have brought bullying to a new level. It becomes a more constant, ever-present threat—cyberbullying” (Frances Dalomba, “Social Media: The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly,” Lifespan, [lifespan.org](http://lifespan.org/).). (041)
    

## Avoid comparison with others and be authentic

“We live in a world that feeds on comparisons, labeling, and criticism,” which is perpetuated by the use of social media (099). Leaders warned of “various negative elements that can exist in social media, including debilitating comparisons and idealized reality” (035). Because social media users tend to share their lives “in a self-aggrandizing or fake way” and then consume the “‘almost exclusively… fake lives of… social media “friends,”’” many are left with unreasonable expectations, decreased mental health, and a shrinking view of self worth (065). To counter these debilitating effects, leaders counseled members “to be authentic in the use of social media” (065) and avoid comparison with others as they use technology: “With so many appropriate and inspired uses of technology, let us use it to teach, inspire, and lift ourselves and to encourage others to become their finest—rather than to portray our idealized virtual selves” (016).

  

-   “Elder David A. Bednar recently cautioned members to be authentic in the use of social media. A prominent thought leader, Arthur C. Brooks, has emphasized this point. He observes that when using social media, we tend to broadcast the smiling details of our lives but not the hard times at school or work. We portray an incomplete life—sometimes in a self-aggrandizing or fake way. We share this life, and then we consume the “almost exclusively … fake lives of [our] social media ‘friends.’” Brooks asserts, “How could it not make you feel worse to spend part of your time pretending to be happier than you are, and the other part of your time seeing how much happier others seem to be than you?” (065)
    
-   “We live in a world that feeds on comparisons, labeling, and criticism. Instead of seeing through the lens of social media, we need to look inward for the godly attributes to which we each lay claim. These godly qualities and longings cannot be posted on Pinterest or Instagram.” (099)
    
-   “He [Satan] immerses us in the  various negative elements that can exist in social media, including debilitating comparisons and idealized reality.  In addition, he camouflages other dark, harmful content found online, such as pornography, blatant attacks on others through cyberbullying, and sowing misinformation to cause doubt and fear in our hearts and minds. Cunningly he whispers, ‘Just follow me, and you will surely be happy.’” (035)
    
-   “Two additional risks related to social media are idealized reality and debilitating comparisons.” (016)
    
-   “With so many appropriate and inspired uses of technology, let us use it to teach, inspire, and lift ourselves and to encourage others to become their finest—rather than to portray our idealized virtual selves.” (016)
    

## Moderate resources

A comprehensive statement from the leaders of the Church explains that there is duality in the use of technology. “A wonderful example of the need for moderation, balance, and wisdom is the use of the Internet. It can be used to do missionary outreach, to assist with priesthood responsibilities, to find precious ancestors for sacred temple ordinances, and much more. The potential for good is enormous. We also know that it can transmit much that is evil, including pornography, digital cruelty, and anonymous yakking. It can also perpetuate foolishness. As Brother Randall L. Ridd poignantly taught at the last general conference, speaking of the Internet, ‘You can get caught up in endless loops of triviality that waste your time and degrade your potential.’” (065).

  

-   “My intent is not to discourage participation in sports or the use of the Internet or other worthwhile activities young people enjoy. They are the kind of activities that require moderation, balance, and wisdom. When used wisely, they enrich our lives.” (065)

-   The powerful impact of the internet is a blessing and a challenge, unique to our time. (147)
    

  

# Intentionally Seek (agency)

Though there are many recommendations from conference talks to limit technology or guard against it in some form, these are balanced by the counsel to use the power of technology for good, to improve our lives and the lives of those around us. This counsel includes seeking content and experiences for our own personal improvement and using it to improve relationships with others. There is a strong focus on how the use of technology has spread the outreach of sharing the gospel, expanding family history, and making gospel content easily accessible for all.

## Seeking content/experiences for ourselves (personal improvement)

### Live life intentionally; Prioritize better and best things

It was often emphasized that technology is a powerful tool that could be used for good if members let it. One leader remarked, “As in life, the Internet will give you more and more of what you seek. If your desires are pure, the Internet can magnify them, making it ever easier to engage in worthy pursuits.” (017) Another leader reiterated the importance of making a conscious effort to use technology properly: “Let us be careful and not casual in our use of technology. Continually seek for ways that technology can draw us closer to the Savior and allow us to accomplish His work as we prepare for His Second Coming.” (013) All leaders acknowledged that technology could be used in righteous pursuits, but that using it needs to be an active and not a passive decision. In this manner, the possibilities of the potential good use of technology are endless.

  

-   “As in life, the Internet will give you more and more of what you seek. If your desires are pure, the Internet can magnify them, making it ever easier to engage in worthy pursuits. But the opposite is also true.” (017)
    
-   “Let us be careful and not casual in our use of technology. Continually seek for ways that technology can draw us closer to the Savior and allow us to accomplish His work as we prepare for His Second Coming.” (013)
    
-   “Young men, remember who you really are. Remember that you hold the holy priesthood. This will inspire you to make correct choices as you use the Internet and throughout your life.” (017)
    
-   “Every time you plug in your phone, use it as a reminder to ask yourself if you have plugged in to the most important source of spiritual power—prayer and scripture study, which will charge you with inspiration through the Holy Ghost” (017)
    
-   “Those “seemingly insignificant” private decisions include how we use our time, what we view on television and the internet, what we read, the art and music with which we surround ourselves at work and at home, what we seek for entertainment, and how we apply our commitment to be honest and truthful. Another seemingly small and simple thing is being civil and cheerful in our personal interactions. [new line] None of these desirable small and simple things will lift us to great things unless they are practiced consistently and continuously.” (027)
    
-   “To help members prepare for the Sabbath, some wards already send an informative email, text, or social media message midweek. In view of this adjustment, we strongly recommend this type of communication.” (046)
    

#### Technology is beneficial when used wisely

-   “The computer is a wonderful instrument when it is properly used.” (022)
    
-   “Technology has expanded, and almost everyone has access to handheld devices that can capture the attention of the human family of God for both great good and unconscionable ill.” (100)
    
-   Helps you “accomplish great things in a short period of time” (017)
    
-   “Now there is nothing wrong with taking advantage of the advances in the technologies inspired by the Lord, but we must be wise in their use. Remember the gift of the Sabbath day...” (034)
    
-   “In addition, most of you have access to amazing technological advances. You communicate through cell phones, text messaging, instant messaging, e-mailing, blogging, Facebook, and other such means. You listen to music on your iPods and MP3 players. This list, of course, represents but a few of the technologies which are available to you.” (098)
    
-   “These technologies are useful and can bring great benefits to us.” (111)
    
-   “Technology, when understood and used for righteous purposes, need not be a threat but rather an enhancement to spiritual communication…” (006)
    
-   “With so many appropriate and inspired uses of technology, let us use it to teach, inspire, and lift ourselves and to encourage others to become their finest—rather than to portray our idealized virtual selves.” (016)
    
-   “Use it [technology] to accelerate your progress toward perfection.” (017)
    

### Seek out uplifting things (content?)

#### Useful for finding spiritual information

One of the benefits of modern technology is the ability to access seemingly unlimited content with a few clicks of a button. This is especially useful as the library of church resources is large and ever expanding. Spiritual content is now easily searchable and learning about and sharing information on any topic is readily available. “We are blessed with excellent online resources, including those developed by the Church, such as text and audio versions of the holy scriptures and general conference, video productions of the life and teachings of Jesus Christ, apps to record our family history, and opportunities to listen to inspiring music.” (014) A specific benefit of technology is the power of broadcasting, which exponentially expands the amounts of viewers that General Conference can reach. “I am thankful too for the miracle of modern communication that allows this conference to reach millions of people throughout the world.” (137) Modern technology has granted access to a truly stunning amount of spiritual information, unlocking this knowledge for members around the world.

  
  

-   “One example: the modern smartphone provides access to incredibly important and uplifting information, including family history and the holy scriptures....” (044)
    
-   “Who could have imagined not very many years ago that the full standard works and years of general conference messages would fit into your pocket? Just having them in your pocket will not protect you, but studying, pondering, and listening to them during quiet moments of each day will enhance communication through the Spirit.” (006)
    
-   “Parents, you may access youth lessons for yourself on [LDS.org](http://lds.org/).“ (109)
    
-   “Be wise in how you embrace technology. Mark important scriptures on your device and refer back to them frequently. If you young people would review a verse of scripture as often as some of you send text messages, you could soon have hundreds of passages of scripture memorized. Those passages would prove to be a powerful source of inspiration and guidance by the Holy Ghost in times of need.” (006)
    
-   “On the other hand, we all know that we are blessed with excellent online resources, including those developed by the Church, such as text and audio versions of the holy scriptures and general conference, video productions of the life and teachings of Jesus Christ, apps to record our family history, and opportunities to listen to inspiring music.” (014)
    
-   “You are growing up with one of the greatest tools for good in the history of man: the Internet.... Right in the palm of your hand you have the wisdom of the ages—more importantly, the words of the prophets, from Old Testament days to President Thomas S. Monson” (017)
    
-   “For many years we heard from the prophet twice a year at general conference. But with the complex issues of our day, President Nelson is speaking much more often in forums, social media, devotionals, and even press briefings.” (045)
    
-   “On a computer, phone, or other electronic device, we can read, listen to, watch, and share the teachings of the prophets.“ (109)
    
-   “A young neighbor of ours found a simple way to ponderize. He puts his weekly scripture on the home screen of his phone.” (126)
    
-   “With that same technology today, we have at our fingertips access to the words of the prophets on nearly any subject.” (136)
    
-   “I invite you to study the topic of mental health in the Life Help section of the Gospel Library app.” (129)
    
-   “...For the Strength of Youth conferences and magazines, the Friend, and the Gospel Living app will help center [youth] in finding joy in Christ.” (131)
    
-   “This choice [subscribing to the Church’s social networks] will bring to your screen the content that is essential to deepen your searching and seeking of the Lord and His teachings, and it will strengthen your desire to understand the gospel. More important, this will help you remember what Christ expects of each of us. [new line] Just as “there is no good soil without a good farmer,”7 likewise will there be no good online harvest unless we prioritize from the very beginning that which is accessible to our fingers and our minds.” (014)
    

##### Able to view general conference

-   “Few could have imagined today’s world, where anyone who has access to the Internet with a smartphone, tablet, or computer can receive the messages of this meeting.” (076)
    
-   “How grateful we are for the technology that allows us to be connected as one great worldwide gathering of disciples of Jesus Christ. General conference last April was viewed by more people than any preceding it, and we have every expectation that will happen again.” (056)
    
-   “I am thankful too for the miracle of modern communication that allows this conference to reach millions of people throughout the world.” (137)
    
-   “through the use of technology we have been able to meet together and worship on this Sunday morning” (037)
    
-   “This assembly is in whatever part of the world you might be, even if your connection is no more than the audio of your smartphone. “ (026)
    
-   “Even these general conference sessions would not be possible without the wonderful tools of technology.” (007)
    
-   “Heavenly Father has provided the way. At this conference, 97 percent of the Church can hear these messages in their own language. Millions of members in 197 countries will watch this conference in 95 languages. In just two or three days the messages will appear on [LDS.org](http://lds.org/) in English, and within one week they will begin to be available in 52 languages. Now we receive the printed Church magazines within three weeks of the general conference. No longer do we have to wait months for the talks to arrive by mail. On a computer, phone, or other electronic device, we can read, listen to, watch, and share the teachings of the prophets. Anytime, anywhere, we can enlarge our knowledge, strengthen our faith and testimony, protect our families, and lead them safely home.” (109)
    
-   “We are grateful that broadcast technology now gives Church leaders the capacity to conduct detailed training by addressing specific audiences in the field.” (146)
    
-   “Because of technology, perhaps more of God’s children will hear and recognize the word of God this weekend than during any other two days in history.” (057)
    

  

#### Useful for finding valuable information

The leaders of the Church acknowledge that the benefits of technology expand far beyond the spiritual implications. One leader stated, “There is much that is good with our easy access to communication and information. I have found it helpful to access research articles, conference talks, and ancestral records, and to receive e-mails, Facebook reminders, tweets, and texts.” (001) Another leader remarked, “With technology you are witnessing an explosion of knowledge.” (107) In praise of secular learning, current Church president Russell M. Nelson stated: “Education is very important. I consider it a religious responsibility. The glory of God is intelligence” (Choices for Eternity, 2022). As secular learning is valued by the Church, leaders are supportive of the expansion of secular knowledge through technology.

  
  

-   “There is much that is good with our easy access to communication and information. I have found it helpful to access research articles, conference talks, and ancestral records, and to receive e-mails, Facebook reminders, tweets, and texts.” (001)
    

-   “The Internet provides many opportunities for learning.” (009)
    
-   “Greatly expanded and disseminated information” (028)
    
-   “Modern technologies bless us in many ways. They can connect us ... with information... and with news about current events around the world.” (033)
    
-   “Of course it is good to view wholesome entertainment or to obtain interesting information” (061)
    
-   “With technology you are witnessing an explosion of knowledge.” (107)
    
-   “Modern technologies bless us in many ways. They can connect us with friends and family, with information, and with news about current events around the world. “ (114)
    
-   “The other day my 10-year-old son was studying about the human brain on the Internet. He wants to be a surgeon one day. It’s not difficult to note that he is a lot smarter than I am. We like the Internet. At home we communicate with family and friends through social media, by email, and in other ways. My children do much of their schoolwork through the Internet. Whatever the question is, if we need more information, we search it online. In seconds we have a lot of material. This is marvelous. The Internet provides many opportunities for learning.” (009)
    

### Seek to be still (?)

-   “Who could have imagined not very many years ago that the full standard works and years of general conference messages would fit into your pocket? Just having them in your pocket will not protect you, but studying, pondering, and listening to them during quiet moments of each day will enhance communication through the Spirit.” (006)
    

## Seeking connections with others

One of the most well recognized benefits of technology is its ability to connect to each other, shrinking distances through social media platforms. This expands social networks and completely changes the impact that one person can have just by posting on social media. These connections, when paired with the Church and its practices, can facilitate sharing the gospel, family history research, and serving others.

### Share the Gospel

Church leaders often “encourage people, young and old, to use the Internet and social media to reach out and share their religious beliefs.” (060) This admonition applies to members as well as full-time, volunteer missionaries of the Church, especially after the COVID-19 pandemic prevented many common missionary activities like proselytizing door to door. “Of necessity, we are now learning how to use a variety of methods, including technology, to invite people—in normal and natural ways—to come and see, come and help, and come and belong.” (007) Overall, technology has drastically changed how the gospel is being shared today. “With so many social media resources and a multitude of more or less useful gadgets at our disposal, sharing the good news of the gospel is easier and the effects more far-reaching than ever before.” (125) It has rapidly grown the amount of people missionaries can reach, and it provides an easy way for members to share their beliefs.

  
  
  

#### Members Sharing the Gospel

-   The gentleman knew little about his heritage, so Kevin pulled out his phone, saying, “I have an app that connects people to their families. Let’s see what we can find.”... “[Kevin] then found a way to witness of the Savior’s light and love” (113)
    
-   “Be more open on social media in talking about your trust in Christ.” (053)
    
-   “Jimmy Ton, who grew up Buddhist, was impressed by a family who shared their life on YouTube. When he learned that they were members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, he studied the gospel online by himself, read the Book of Mormon using the app, and was baptized after meeting with the missionaries in college. Elder Ton is now a full-time missionary himself." (008)
    
-   “My dear young friends, perhaps the Lord’s encouragement to “open [your] mouths”[9](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2011/04/waiting-on-the-road-to-damascus?lang=eng#note9) might today include “use your hands” to blog and text message the gospel to all the world!“ (125)
    
-   “Now in this day of the Internet, there are new and exciting ways you can do missionary work. You can invite friends and neighbors to visit the new [mormon.org](http://mormon.org/) Web site. If you have blogs and online social networks, you could link your sites to [mormon.org](http://mormon.org/). And there you can create your own personal profile. Each profile includes an expression of belief, an experience, and a testimony.” (084)
    
-   “You do not come to the table with empty hands but with technology and social media at your command. We need you; the Lord needs you to be even more engaged in this great cause” (133)
    
-   “As you utilize the Internet, you may come across ongoing conversations about the Church. When directed by the Spirit, do not hesitate to add your voice to these conversations.” (060)
    
-   “Because “the gospel of Christ … is the power of God unto salvation,” you can be confident, courageous, and humble as you share it. Confidence, courage, and humility may seem like contradictory attributes, but they are not. They reflect the Savior’s invitation not to hide gospel values and principles under a bushel but to let your light shine, that your good works may glorify your Father in Heaven. There are many normal and natural ways to do this, from daily acts of kindness to personal testimonials on YouTube, Facebook, Instagram, or Twitter to simple conversations with people you meet.”(011)
    
-   “Today’s “manner of conversation” seems to involve the Internet more and more. We encourage people, young and old, to use the Internet and the social media to reach out and share their religious beliefs.” (060)
    
-   “New technologies such as this make it possible for the gospel message to be spread throughout the world. The Church Web sites are good examples of how you can use this technology as a wonderful resource of inspiration, help, and learning. They can be a blessing for you priesthood holders, your families, and the Church.” (063)
    
-   “For those using the Internet and mobile phones, there are new ways to invite others to ‘come and see.’ Let’s make sharing our faith online more a part of our daily life. [LDS.org](http://lds.org), [Mormon.org](http://mormon.org), Facebook, Twitter—all provide opportunities.” (094)
    
-   “Sister Mayra is a recent convert from Ecuador. Her joy in the gospel skyrocketed immediately following her baptism as she invited friends and loved ones around her through social media accounts. Many family members and friends who saw her posts responded with questions. Mayra connected with them, often inviting them to her home to meet with the missionaries together. Mayra’s parents, her siblings, her aunt, two cousins, and several of her friends were baptized because she courageously invited them to “come and see,” “come and serve,” and “come and belong.” Through her normal and natural invitations, over 20 people have accepted her invitation to be baptized members of the Church of Jesus Christ. This came about because Sister Mayra simply invited others to experience the joy she felt as a member of the Church.”(150)
    
-   “In our digital age, members often share messages through social media. There are hundreds, if not thousands, of uplifting things you might find worthy of sharing. This content offers invitations to “come and see,” “come and serve,” and “come and belong.”(150)
    
-   “There are hundreds of invitations we can extend to others. We can invite others to “come and see” a sacrament service, a ward activity, an online video that explains the gospel of Jesus Christ.” (150)
    
-   “As amazing as modern technology can be for spreading the message of the gospel of Jesus Christ and helping us stay connected to family and friends. . .” (119)
    
-   “Brothers and sisters, with the blessings of modern technology, we can express gratitude and joy about God’s great plan for His children in a way that can be heard not only around our workplace but around the world. Sometimes a single phrase of testimony can set events in motion that affect someone’s life for eternity.” (125)
    
-   “When you hand them a Book of Mormon, you are opening their minds and hearts to the word of God. You do not need to carry printed copies of the book with you. You can easily share it from your mobile phone from the scriptures section of the Gospel Library app.Think of all those who could be blessed by the gospel in their lives, and then send to them a copy of the Book of Mormon from your phone. Remember to include your testimony and how this book has blessed your life.” (159)
    
-   “Members of the Church stand as witnesses of God at all times, in all things, and in all places. Opportunities to do this in the digital universe using inspiring content of our own or sharing uplifting content prepared by others are endless. We testify when we love, share, and invite, even online. Your tweets, direct messages, and posts will take on a higher, holier purpose when you also use social media to show how the gospel of Jesus Christ shapes your life.” (160)
    
-   “The new version of For the Strength of Youth is available online in 50 different languages and will also be available in print. It will be a significant help for making choices in your life. Please embrace it as your own and share it with your friends.” (162)
    

  

#### Missionaries Sharing the Gospel

-   “Emma and her companion in the Netherlands were stretched in those first several weeks—stretched to tears in many instances. With only brief opportunities for in-person interaction and limited outdoor exposure, Emma’s reliance on God increased. We prayed with her online and asked how we could help. She asked us to connect with friends she was teaching online! [new line] Our family began to connect online, one by one, with Emma’s friends in the Netherlands. We invited them to join our weekly, online, extended-family Come, Follow Me study. Floor, Laura, Renske, Freek, Benjamin, Stal, and Muhammad all have become our friends. Some of our friends from the Netherlands have entered “in at the strait gate” (3 Nephi 14:13). Others are being shown “the straitness of the path, and the narrowness of the gate, by which they should enter” (2 Nephi 31:9). They are our brothers and sisters in Christ. Each week we “count it all joy” as we work together in our progress on the covenant path.” (029)
    
-   “To the missionaries currently serving, we thank you. Your mission has been during a worldwide pandemic. As a result, your mission experience has been unlike my mission experience or the experiences of any missionaries who served before 2020. I know it has not been easy. But even during these difficult times, the Lord has had a work for you to do, and you have done it wonderfully well. For example, you have used technology in new ways to find those who are ready to learn about the Restoration of the gospel of Jesus Christ.” (152)
    
-   “[Technology] can be used to do missionary outreach,... and much more. The potential for good is enormous.” (065)
    

#### Members and Missionaries Working Together

-   “A man I met recently, whose name is Wes and who is attending the conference today, accepted Christ’s invitation to learn of Him and of His gospel and began to experience the awe of His love after 27 years of distancing himself from the covenant path. He told me that one day he was contacted via Facebook by a missionary, Elder Jones, who was temporarily assigned to Wes’s area before going to his originally assigned mission in Panama. When Elder Jones came across Wes’s profile, not even knowing beforehand that he was already a member of the Church, he felt the guidance of the Holy Ghost and knew that he should immediately contact Wes. He quickly acted on this impression. Wes was amazed by this unexpected contact and began to realize that the Lord was aware of him despite his distance from the covenant path.” (145)
    
-   “To share the gospel, young members in Boston started several blogs. Those who joined the Church began their learning online, followed by discussions with the missionaries. This experience also helped the youth have greater faith in talking about the gospel in person. One of them said, ‘This isn’t missionary work. This is missionary fun.’” (094)
    
-   “Brothers and sisters, as surely as the Lord has inspired more missionaries to serve, He is also awakening the minds and opening the hearts of more good and honest people to receive His missionaries. You already know them or will know them. They are in your family and live in your neighborhood. They walk past you on the street, sit by you in school, and connect with you online. You too are an important part of this unfolding miracle.” (094)
    
-   “During the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic, Brother Wisan from Thailand felt prompted to share his feelings and impressions of what he was learning in his study of the Book of Mormon on his social media account. In one of his particularly personal posts, he shared a story of two Book of Mormon missionaries, Alma and Amulek. His brother, Winai, although set in his religious beliefs, was touched by the post and responded, unexpectedly asking, “Can I get that book in Thai?” Wisan wisely arranged for a copy of the Book of Mormon to be delivered by two sister missionaries, who began teaching his brother. Wisan joined in virtual lessons, during which he shared his feelings about the Book of Mormon. Winai learned to pray and study with a truth-seeking spirit, to accept and embrace the truth. Within months, Winai was baptized!” (150)
    
-   “In the past, we might have been so tied to traditional approaches that it took a pandemic to open our eyes. Perhaps we were still building with sandstone when granite was already available. Of necessity, we are now learning how to use a variety of methods, including technology, to invite people—in normal and natural ways—to come and see, come and help, and come and belong.” (007)
    

#### Technology is Rapidly Expanding Missionary Work

-   “Because of technology, perhaps more of God’s children will hear and recognize the word of God this weekend than during any other two days in history.” (057)
    
-   “With so many social media resources and a multitude of more or less useful gadgets at our disposal, sharing the good news of the gospel is easier and the effects more far-reaching than ever before.” (125)
    
-   “The 179 years that have passed since The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints was officially organized have been extraordinary by any measure. Never in recorded history has there been a period of such remarkable progress in terms of science and technology. These advances have helped to facilitate gospel growth and expansion throughout the world. But they have also contributed to the rise of materialism and self-indulgence and to the decline of morality.”(135)
    
-   “These modalities have generated hundreds of millions of likes, shares, views, retweets, and pins and have become very effective and efficient in sharing the gospel with family, friends, and associates.” (016)
    
-   Can be used to “take his work to the next level, to share the gospel in ways that are beyond my generation’s wildest imagination. Where generations past influenced their neighbors and their town, you have the power through the Internet and social media to reach beyond borders and influence the whole world.” (017)

-   “The use of technology in sharing the gospel and doing the Lord’s work has spread throughout the Church.” (007)
    
-   “We desire to be more effective in fulfilling our divinely appointed responsibility to proclaim the restored gospel in all the world.” (116)

-   “At all times of the day across the entire world, the Church and its teachings are being discussed on the Internet, on blogs and social networks, by people who have never written for a newspaper or a magazine. They are making videos and sharing them online. These are ordinary people—both members of our faith and of other faiths—who are talking about The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.” (060)
    
-   “Today we have many resources to share the gospel that were not available in earlier generations. We have TV, the internet, and social media channels.” (116)
    
-   “That [making marriage and family a high priority] is why the Church actively participates in and provides leadership to various coalitions and ecumenical efforts to strengthen the family. It is why we share our family-focused values in the media and on social media. It is why we share our genealogical and extended family records with all nations.” (068)
    

### Research family history

One of the beliefs of the Church is that every person must receive ordinances, like baptism, in order to obtain the highest kingdom in heaven. As many people have passed away without these ordinances, there was a way provided for them to receive the ordinances through the practice of worshiping in temples, where the living will perform this work in behalf of the dead.(028) For example, the living are baptized by proxy for the dead, by name. Because information about each person is necessary for these ordinances, family history work and research became a very important part of the Church. “The Prophet Joseph Smith said, ‘The greatest responsibility in this world that God has laid upon us is to seek after our dead.’ New technology makes it easier than ever to fulfill that responsibility.” (067) Technology hasn’t just made researching ancestors easier, it has also rapidly grown. “Family history work, heaven-blessed by technology, has dramatically increased in the past few years.“ (054)

  

-   “One example: the modern smartphone provides access to incredibly important and uplifting information, including family history and the holy scriptures....” (044)
    
-   “God’s love is so great that, except for the few who deliberately become sons of perdition, He has provided a destiny of glory for all of His children. “All of His children” includes all who are dead. We perform ordinances for them by proxy in our temples. The purpose of the Church of Jesus Christ is to qualify His children for the highest degree of glory, which is exaltation or eternal life. For those who do not desire or qualify for that, God has provided other, though lesser, kingdoms of glory.”(028)
    
-   “I have an app that connects people to their families. Let’s see what we can find.” (039)
    
-   “I was spending a lot of time playing computer games. When I started indexing, I didn’t have time to play games. At first I thought, ‘Oh no! How can that be!’ When this project was over, I even lost interest in gaming. … Genealogical work is something that we can do here on earth, and it will remain in heaven.” (141)
    
-   “One of the most troublesome aspects of our temple activity is that as we get more and more temples … across the earth there is duplication of effort in proxy work. … We, therefore, have been engaged for some time in a very difficult undertaking. … The solution lies in complex computer technology....” (067)
    
-   “The Prophet Joseph Smith said, ‘The greatest responsibility in this world that God has laid upon us is to seek after our dead.’ New technology makes it easier than ever to fulfill that responsibility.  Temple and family history work is now facilitated by a system known as the ‘new FamilySearch.’ This Internet-based system helps members identify their ancestors, determine what ordinance work needs to be done for them, and prepare their names for the temple...” (067)
    
-   “At home, with the aid of a computer or mobile device, you can identify souls who are yearning for their ordinances.“ (144)
    
-   “Consider the spiritual connections that are formed when a young woman helps her grandmother enter family information into a computer or when a young man sees the name of his great-grandfather on a census record.“ (140)
    
-   “Add data gathered from others of your family. Then avail yourself of assistance from your ward or branch family history consultant. The new FamilySearch system enables a consultant to perform all needed computer functions for you, including preparing names for the temple.” (067)
    
-   We each have more family with whom to connect. If you think your great-aunt has completed all your family genealogy, please find your cousins and cousins’ cousins. Connect your living memory family names with the 10 billion searchable names FamilySearch now has in its online collection and the 1.3 billion individuals in its Family Tree.” (148)
    
-   “It is no coincidence that FamilySearch and other tools have come forth at a time when young people are so familiar with a wide range of information and communication technologies. Your fingers have been trained to text and tweet to accelerate and advance the work of the Lord—not just to communicate quickly with your friends. The skills and aptitude evident among many young people today are a preparation to contribute to the work of salvation. … [new line] Parents and leaders, you will stand all amazed at how rapidly your children and the youth of the Church become highly skilled with these tools. In fact, you will learn valuable lessons from these young people about effectively using these resources. The youth can offer much to older individuals who are uncomfortable with or intimidated by technology or are unfamiliar with FamilySearch. You also will count your many blessings as young people devote more time to family history work and temple service and less time to video games, surfing the Internet, and Facebooking.” (018)
    
-   “The internet is a powerful tool; the home is now our primary family history center.
    
-   “It can be used to do missionary outreach, to assist with priesthood responsibilities, to find precious ancestors for sacred temple ordinances, and much more. The potential for good is enormous.” (065)
    
-   Family history technology has also advanced dramatically. President Howard W. Hunter declared in November 1994: “We have begun using information technology to hasten the sacred work of providing ordinances for the deceased. The role of technology … has been accelerated by the Lord himself. … However, we stand only on the threshold of what we can do with these tools.” (095)
    
-   “In the worldwide membership of the Church, fifty-one percent of adults currently do not have both parents in the Family Tree section of the Church’s FamilySearch Internet site. Sixty-five percent of adults do not have all four grandparents listed. Remember, we without our roots and branches cannot be saved. Church members need to obtain and input this vital information. (095)
    
-   In the 19 years since this prophetic statement, the acceleration of technology is almost unbelievable. A 36-year-old mother of young children recently exclaimed to me, “Just think—we have gone from microfilm readers in dedicated family history centers to sitting at my kitchen table with my computer doing family history after my children are finally asleep.” Brothers and sisters, family history centers are now in our homes....(095)
    
-   The leadership of the Church has issued a clarion call to the rising generation to lead the way in the use of technology to experience the spirit of Elijah, to search out their ancestors, and to perform temple ordinances for them. Much of the heavy lifting in hastening the work of salvation for both the living and the dead will be done by you young people.” (095)

#### Technology has accelerated Family History and Temple Work

-   “Technology has accelerated proxy temple work by helping to avoid duplication of work performed and by making it easier for all to participate in finding ancestors” (067)
    
-   technology (FamilySearch) can be used to “accelerate and advance the work of the Lord” (not just to communicate quickly with your friends); and “contribute to the work of salvation”. (018)
    
-   “ (025)
    
-   “Family history work, heaven-blessed by technology, has dramatically increased in the past few years.“ (054)
    
-   “From that day to this, interest in exploring one’s family history has grown exponentially. At ever-increasing rates, people seem drawn to their ancestry with more than just casual curiosity. Genealogical libraries, associations, and technologies have emerged around the world to support this interest. The internet’s power to enhance communications has enabled families to work together to do family history research with a speed and thoroughness never before possible.” (090)
    

### Serve others

Technology has been used throughout the Church in other positive ways besides sharing the gospel and family history work. Many members “have found ways to encourage others and share our Savior’s light.” (052) Some of these include “a simple gesture of inclusion and welcome at church, a thoughtful email or text message, [and] a personal contact at a difficult time.” (037) Members are encouraged to participate in a program called ‘ministering’, where members of the congregation are paired with another member in a companionship to ‘minister to’ or serve certain individuals in the congregation. In this organized fashion, all members have someone to serve and someone to turn to for help. Technology also increases the ability to minister, because “it [ministering] looks like visiting in person or talking on the phone or chatting online or texting.” (038) Additionally, the Church has created other initiatives to facilitate service. “The Church responds to this charge in a wide variety of ways, including the JustServe app, where it’s available, that matches volunteers with service opportunities.” (130) JustServe.org was created by the Church as a public service designed to organize service opportunities and is a great example of how technology is being used to spread goodness.

  
  
  

-   “My high school daughter and a group of her friends use social media and text messaging to share scriptures with each other.” (126)
    
-   “The Church responds to this charge in a wide variety of ways, including the JustServe app, where it’s available, that matches volunteers with service opportunities.” (130)
    
-   “You young women have also been remarkable. Though social media has been flooded with contention, many of you have found ways to encourage others and share our Savior’s light.” (052)
    
-   “I have heard countless stories of brothers and sisters who were blessed by a simple gesture of inclusion and welcome at church, a thoughtful email or text message, a personal contact at a difficult time....” (037)
    
-   “...By the way, the Internet, social media, and other technologies are tools the Lord has placed in your hands to help you exercise your priesthood duties and extend the influence of truth and virtue.” (073)
    
-   “Using them appropriately can bring forth the power of heaven and allow us to witness miracles as we seek to gather scattered Israel on both sides of the veil.” (013)
    
-   “To help members prepare for the Sabbath, some wards already send an informative email, text, or social media message midweek. In view of this adjustment [two hour Church and trying to keep Sacrament Meeting more focused on the Savior], we strongly recommend this type of communication.” **(046)
    
-   “It can be used to do missionary outreach, to assist with priesthood responsibilities, to find precious ancestors for sacred temple ordinances, and much more. The potential for good is enormous.” (065)
    

#### Ministering

-   “Ministering brothers and sisters, young women and young men, and others have reached out  to provide contact, conversation, yard care, meals, messages via technology, and the sacrament ordinance to bless those in need....” (059)
    
-   “As we serve in West Africa, my wife, Nuria, has done a remarkable job ministering to and remaining connected with our family and grandchildren across the ocean. She does this by using technology. She reads books to the younger grandchildren. She teaches the older granddaughters topics like the story of our family, science, the history of Puerto Rico, the Articles of Faith, and the gospel of Jesus Christ. Distances nowadays do not limit connecting, belonging, and ministering to and teaching the rising generation of our families.”(153)
    
-   “You have used technology to connect with family and friends, to minister to those who have felt isolated, and to study Come, Follow Me with others.” (052)
    
-   “It [ministering] looks like visiting in person or talking on the phone or chatting online or texting.” (038)
    
-   “As good shepherds and as local conditions permit, we should seek to spend more time ministering to people in their homes. In our ministering, texting and technology should be used to enhance, not replace, personal contact.” (161)
    

### Make meaningful connections with others

The leaders of the Church recognize that technology has even more benefits than providing easy access to information, sharing the gospel and serving others. One of these benefits is the ability to connect with others and foster meaningful relationships. “Modern technology can be [amazing] for ... helping us stay connected to family and friends.” (020) “ It is very useful when we cannot be near our loved ones.” (093) The Church encourages healthy relationships and so supports the use of technology in this positive way.

  

-   “[technology has great] value... especially in communication. So much information of man is now at our fingertips.” (010)
    
-   “The computer is a wonderful instrument when it is properly used.” (022)
    
-   “During the pandemic I have met with youth from all over the world in many devotionals, large and small, through broadcasts and social media, and we have discussed their questions.” (045)
    
-   “At home we communicate with family and friends through social media, by email, and in other ways.” (009)
    
-   “...modern technology can be [amazing] for ... helping us stay connected to family and friends...” (020)
    
-   “Since the pandemic we have been discussing Come, Follow Me with our adult children every Sunday over Zoom. It has literally been working miracles. I think it is the first time our daughter has read the Book of Mormon on her own. Today was the last lesson on the Book of Mormon, and we were just finishing when you came by. … I thought you would be interested to hear how Come, Follow Me, Zoom, and a pandemic have provided the opportunity at the right time to change a heart.” (032)
    
-   “Modern technologies bless us in many ways. They can connect us with friends and family...” (033)
    
-   “Find your own best way to connect. Some fathers like to take their sons fishing or to a sporting event. Others like to go on a quiet drive or work side by side in the yard. Some find their sons enjoy conversations at night just before going to bed. Do whatever works best for you. A one-on-one relationship should be a routine part of your stewardship with your sons. Every father needs at least one focused, quality conversation with his sons every month during which they talk about specific things such as school, friends, feelings, video games, text messaging, worthiness, faith, and testimony. Where or when this happens isn’t nearly as important as the fact that it happens.” (082)
    
-   “Technology can be a wonderful thing, and it is very useful when we cannot be near our loved ones.” (093)
    
-   “Julie and I are also part of an online group in which family members, friends, and missionaries can share their scripture each week and occasionally include a related thought or testimony. Being part of a group makes it easier to be consistent. “ (126)
    
-   “Today’s technology also allows us to use wireless telephones to exchange information rapidly. Recently Wendy and I were on assignment on another continent when we learned that a new baby had arrived in our family. We received the good news minutes after that birth had occurred half a world away.” (137)
    
-   “Although this is done without a traditional face-to-face interview, technology and revelation combine to provide an experience that is remarkably intimate and personal. Let me tell you how this happens.” (100)
    
-   “Videoconferencing is another way that helps us reach out to Church leaders and members who live far away from Church headquarters.” (100)
    

  

### Miscellaneous

#### Analogies

-   “Computer software developers use conditional statements to tell computers what to do. These are sometimes referred to as if-then statements. As in, if x is true, then do y. The Lord also operates through conditions: conditions of faith, conditions of righteousness, conditions of repentance. There are many examples of conditional statements from God such as:..” (154)
    
-   “God has given us another source for greater knowledge, even knowledge sent from heaven. Our Heavenly Father can give us such knowledge when we navigate the celestial web in our hearts and minds.” (138)
    
-   “I think I know why Lehi was greatly astonished when he first saw it, because I remember my reaction when I first saw and witnessed a GPS unit. In my mind it was a modern-day device “of curious workmanship.” Somehow, in some way I can’t even imagine, this little device, right in my phone, can pinpoint exactly where I am and tell me exactly how to get where I want to go.” (086)
