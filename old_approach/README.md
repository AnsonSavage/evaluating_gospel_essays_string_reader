## How to use:

Copy the Google Doc you want to analyze into Notion. Download the file from notion, which will have converted the formatting to markup language.

Feed this into the reference counter, as shown in `main.py`:

```reference_counter = ReferenceCounter('input/guard_seek_paradigm_dec_7_2022.md')```

The main file will print out a summary. It will also create a .csv file in an `output` folder. This can be opened with spreadsheet software and copied into the document.
